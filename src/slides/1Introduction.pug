  h1 Anatomy of Rx
  aside.notes
    p Hello! Today I'd like to talk about Observables and RxJS.
    p I hope everybody knows about it, because this is not an overview talk.
    p Instead, I'll try to help you intuitively understand how RxJS works so you'll feel more comfortable using it.

  h2 Why?
  ul
    li.fragment .map and .subscribe are fun!
    li.fragment reading this is not fun:
      code.hljs.smaller.
        Maps each source value to the given Observable innerObservable regardless of the source value, and then flattens those resulting Observables into one single Observable, which is the output Observable.

        The output Observables emits values only from the most recently emitted instance of innerObservable.

    p the point of this presentation is that I think it's hard to fully utilize Rx without knowledge of how it works internally
    p 2. Yeah, it's all fine when u just .map and .subscribe
    p 3. However reading this is not fun and I don't think marble diagrams help a lot

    p So, here's what we're going to do
    p Short overview of what is Observable and RxJS to make sure everyone is on the same page.
    p Next we'll look how Rx.Observable looks like in the source code
    p Explain some non-obvious behavior examples
